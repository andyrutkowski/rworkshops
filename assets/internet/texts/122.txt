FULL TEXT
In "The Battle Over Obama's Internet Surrender " (Information Age, June 13), L. Gordon Crovitz argues that the proposal submitted by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann) hands authoritarian regimes power to censor the internet in the U.S. and around the world. The internet companies I represent disagree. By opening control of the internet beyond the U.S. government, Icann's plan aligns the interests of internet users, prevents capture by any one stakeholder group and lays the foundation for a stable and secure internet of the future.
The members of the Internet Association, nearly 40 of the most successful and best capitalized internet companies, support Icann's proposed transition and have repeatedly stated as much. Why would internet companies, with so much at stake in the future success of the internet, support any proposal that decreases the likelihood of that success? The only answer is that they wouldn't.
The internet has become a cornerstone of innovation not only in the U.S., but throughout the world. To better reflect this reality, it is essential that participation in Icann be comprised of a diverse, international multistakeholder group whose members share the common goal of ensuring a free and open internet that fosters and spreads innovation across the globe.
What's more, opposition to Icann's proposal is counterintuitive at best. Calls to stop the transition of Icann's functions to a global multistakeholder community amount to endorsing a system in which the federal government alone regulates and polices the internet without input from the private sector or individuals. The self-regulatory approach developed through the multistakeholder process benefits all.
