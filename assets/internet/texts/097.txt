Full text: Jack Ma, chief executive of Chinese Internet company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., said he is "interested" in buying Yahoo Inc. and was approached by private-equity firms and others about a potential deal.
After Mr. Ma's comments, made Friday to an audience at a "China 2.0" event at Stanford University, it wasn't clear over the weekend whether Alibaba had taken formal steps toward a purchase of Yahoo.
Mr. Ma's spokesman declined to elaborate on Mr Ma's remarks, saying "they speak for themselves."
A Yahoo spokeswoman also declined to comment.
A bid, if one materializes, would mark Alibaba's most ambitious effort yet to broaden its reach. Mr. Ma hasn't disguised the company's ambitions to increase its presence in the U.S. At the same time, Alibaba, which is based in Hangzhou, China, faces increasing competition at home, and it is still working to put behind it a fraud scandal at its business-focused online-trading unit that came to light earlier this year.
Any potential bid could raise concerns among regulators and lawmakers in Washington. A deal would be among the largest purchases of a U.S. operation by a Chinese company, and it comes amid tensions between the U.S. and China over Internet security. Google Inc. has said hackers in China were responsible for attacks on its operations, and U.S. authorities have been probing those incidents. Chinese officials have strenuously denied that the government is involved in those cyberattacks.
Of course, Alibaba is a private company and the Chinese government has no ownership stake in it. Also, Alibaba has longstanding ties to the U.S.
"More than three million U.S. small businesses are registered users on Alibaba.com and use us to source products from around the world to make their businesses more efficient and more profitable, allowing them to create more jobs in America," an Alibaba spokesman said. Also, large U.S. companies such as Procter & Gamble Co. use Alibaba's Taobao.com to reach Chinese consumers.
Taobao has been singled out by the U.S. Trade Representative as a "notorious" market for piracy and counterfeiting, though in an April report, U.S. officials said the company made strides in addressing their concerns.
Yahoo owns significant stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan that make up a major chunk of Yahoo's overall market value, which stands at roughly $17 billion. Mr. Ma has previously sought to buy back Yahoo's nearly 40% stake in his Chinese Internet empire and has engaged in a war of words with Yahoo in recent years over a variety of matters.
When asked about his friendship with Yahoo director and co-founder Jerry Yang, Mr. Ma said Friday that it was business, not personal, an Alibaba spokesman confirmed. Mr. Ma's comments come on the heels of the firing last month of Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz after she was unable to jump-start growth at the once highflying Web company.
Yahoo's board is putting a higher priority on evaluating a potential sale of all or parts of the Internet company over its search for a new CEO, people familiar with the matter have said. That said, Yahoo's board has begun to engage with executive-search firms. The search firms may be asked to look for candidates who could help sell some or all of Yahoo, or try to turn around the company, one of these people said.
Yahoo's board is open to hiring a leader "who is open-minded to a broad range of options," including a sale of the company, said a person familiar with the matter. The board also is interested in potentially finding a new CEO with "consumer experience" who could help Yahoo launch new services and stay relevant in the age of Facebook and Google, this person said.
The Wall Street Journal previously reported that private-equity firms such as Silver Lake Partners and media executive Peter Chernin -- who has talked to Providence Equity Partners about teaming up -- have approached Yahoo on possible deals. It is unclear what those parties have proposed.
