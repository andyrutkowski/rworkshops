The "worm" program that disabled thousands of computers nationwide was intended simply to enter computers, but an error made it go haywire, the graduate student who designed it testified today.
"My purpose was to see if I could write a program that would spread as widely as possible," Robert T. Morris Jr. told jurors in his federal computer tampering trial.
"The worm spread on the network far faster than I expected," said Morris, 25, who spoke publicly for the first time about the November 1988 attack that paralyzed an estimated 6,000 computers linked to Internet.
Questioned by federal prosecutor Mark Rasch, the suspended Cornell University student testified that he designed the worm to break into Internet by gathering passwords from various universities and, without permission, decoding them to ensure the worm would spread widely. He also said he took steps to make the worm harmless and protect it from easy eradication.
During questioning by defense attorney Thomas Guidoboni, Morris said he thought the worm would duplicate a few times a day or every few hours, but he made a programming error.
After releasing the worm from Cornell at about 8 p.m. on Nov. 2, 1988, he went out for dinner. When he returned about three hours later, he said, he noticed Cornell's own computer was slow to respond to commands.
On finding copies of the worm in the Cornell system, he said he knew it was spreading and was not working the way he intended. He said he started to get scared.
Morris said he considered sending out a second worm to track down and destroy the first one but decided against that after seeing the unpredictable nature of the first worm. He also was unsure he could get into the computer system once the worm had begun to cripple it, he said.
Instead, he said he called Andrew Sudduth, a friend at Harvard University, and asked him to send a message on an electronic bulletin board read mainly by Internet users. Morris said he wanted to apologize for unleashing the worm and tell users how to eliminate it.
Sudduth testified at Morris's trial Wednesday that he eventually did send a warning message. But it didn't show up on the computer system for two days because the route he picked to keep his identity a secret already was backed up with electronic mail, Sudduth said.
Lawyers said they expected to give closing statements Monday.
If convicted, Morris, of Arnold, Md., faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
