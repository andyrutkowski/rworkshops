Typical American Internet user in 2004
Full Text
Eight years on the Internet is like a lifetime elsewhere.
In that time, tens of thousands of Web sites have been born, prospered, died -- and now are replaced by whole new generations of Internet sites.
In less than a decade, we have witnessed the spectacular rise, subsequent splatter and eventual mainstreaming of online commerce, online information services and online communication.
We've watched computers get faster, cheaper and more portable -- from notebook computers to wireless Internet access. We've come to rely on e-mail as a top source of communication. Typewriters are a thing of the past.
How much have things changed? To answer that, compare the online worlds of 1996 and 2004, with help from ComScore Networks, which has data tracking Web traffic since 1996.
