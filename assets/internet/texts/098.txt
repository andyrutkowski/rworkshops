Abstract: In another sign that the authorities are stepping up control over the internet, the internet security general command of the Beijing public security bureau, officially established on April 30, was given a higher status than the municipal bureau's internet operations, becoming "deputy bureau-chief level". The mainland had 457 million internet users at the end of last year, according to the China Internet Network Information Centre, a government-affiliated group that compiles industry statistics. That's more than the combined populations of the US and Japan. Its internet surveillance system, also known as the "Great Firewall", requires domestic operators to self-censor content deemed politically incorrect by the government, and blocks overseas services such as YouTube. "It is part of a pattern of elevated controls and heightened alert that will continue through at least this year," Clark said yesterday. "It is a reflection of the government's concern about the internet."

Full text: The central government has created a new state agency to oversee the world's largest internet market.
The State Council said yesterday that the new State Internet Information Office, with resources pooled from the propaganda, industry and information technology and public security departments, would be responsible for strengthening management of internet content and handling day-to-day regulation of news and related services.
The new agency is headed by Wang Chen , who is also director of State Council Information Office (SCIO). His deputies will be SCIO deputy director Qian Qiaoqian, Deputy Industry and Information Technology Minister Xi Guohua and Deputy Public Security Minister Zhang Xinfeng.
It will oversee the development and co-ordination of news portals, penalise offending web services and extend guidance to providers of technological services. It will also monitor online game, video and e-publishing services, Xinhua reported.
Various ministries, as well as a bureau under SCIO, were responsible for regulating the booming internet sector previously. The new state internet office, headed by a ministerial-level official, centralises the responsibilities and functions. It also has more power to exercise control over the internet because of its enhanced status.
The new agency adds a second function to the SCIO and it will not have a separate staff, just a few officials concurrently holding positions in other government departments.
In another sign that the authorities are stepping up control over the internet, the internet security general command of the Beijing public security bureau, officially established on April 30, was given a higher status than the municipal bureau's internet operations, becoming "deputy bureau-chief level".
The internet operations of the public security system are aimed at various online crimes.
Commentaries in the official media after the new agency was set up called for more effective checks on the growing influence of some harmful online content.
A commentary on Newssc.net, citing US laws to protect juniors and guard against junk mail, called for a more effective crackdown on web-based pornography and sex services.
An editorial in the Beijing News focused on what it called web triads - organised promotional or smear campaigns.
The mainland had 457 million internet users at the end of last year, according to the China Internet Network Information Centre, a government-affiliated group that compiles industry statistics. That's more than the combined populations of the US and Japan. Its internet surveillance system, also known as the "Great Firewall", requires domestic operators to self-censor content deemed politically incorrect by the government, and blocks overseas services such as YouTube.
The new State Internet Information Office may be Beijing's way of "formalising" its existing internet controls, according to Duncan Clark, chairman of industry consultants BDA China.
"It is part of a pattern of elevated controls and heightened alert that will continue through at least this year," Clark said yesterday. "It is a reflection of the government's concern about the internet."
