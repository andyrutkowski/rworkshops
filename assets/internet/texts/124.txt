1. INTRODUCTION
We are living in the so called „information society‟ or „knowledge society‟ or „information age‟
or „ICT age‟ where information is one of the most important factors of life. Kemp (1976) said,
“Indeed, information has been described as the fifth need of man ranking after air, water, food
and shelter”. Today‟s 21st century world Internet facility has grown immensely over the years. Internet is a
worldwide repository of knowledge bank that allows access to global information at the click of
a mouse. Not only has the internet invaded every sphere of life today but it has marched into

a new dynamic role to play and serve the information society in better ways than before. In this
digital age Internet has changed almost every people‟s life. After the great revolution of ICT,
now every person can use internet for their day to day works.
The use of the internet for teaching, learning and research purposes has received escalating
attention over the last few years. The use of internet is rapidly increasing owing to its efficiency

achieve the same objective with that of traditional way of studying in higher institution.
Lecturers exchange ideas and communicate effectively since teaching, learning and research is
now made easy with the Internet.
