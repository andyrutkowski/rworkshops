News and Views; African-American Internet Users Are a Highly Educated Group
Stailstics on Internet access vary to a great degree. But almost every study shows a continuing huge disparity between blacks and whites in the use of computers and the Internet at home. Some of these studies show that this digital divide is not only large but that it continues to increase to the detriment of blacks.
A new study conducted by the Cultural Access Group (CAG) takes this research a bit further. It examines not simply the extent of Internet access but digs deeper to see how and why different ethnic groups use the World Wide Web. This research, completed in October 2000, included survey responses from nearly 3,500 individuals, more than a fifth of whom were African Americans.
The study found that the average African-American Internet user was 35 years old and had a household income of more than $47,000. But here are the two most startling statistics in the study:
1. Slightly more than three quarters of all African-American Internet users are female. Yet only 35 percent of Internet users generally are women.
2. Some 83 percent of African Americans who use the Internet have at least some college education. Only 61 percent of all Internetusers of all races have some college education.
The authors of the report conclude that black Internet users are an economically, socially, and educationally mature segment of the African-American community. Since black women make up a huge portion of the black online community, it seems clear that black-oriented Web sites should keep the focus of these sites geared toward women. Because these black women are highly educated and career oriented, the authors recommend that black Web sites focus on economic empowerment, professional development, and educational goals. Black women also appear to be interested in obtaining health information online.
Here are some other findings in the CAG study:
- Some 97 percent of Internet users have access to the Internet at home. This is true for only 78 percent of African-American Internetusers.
- One third of all black Internet users are most likely to access the Web at work. This is true for only 20 percent of the general Internetuniverse.
- Cost remains the primary reasons for low Internet use by blacks at home. More than 40 percent of blacks who don't have access to the Internet at home say that it is too expensive for them to afford at-home access.
- Some 36.5 percent of all African-American Internet users reported spending 15 or more hours per week online. More than 54 percent of Internet users generally spend more than 15 hours online per week.
- Slightly more than 30 percent of African-American Internet users reported making a purchase online compared to 69 percent of Internet users generally.
- Only 39 percent of African-American Internet users agree with the statement, "I would be comfortable purchasing with my credit card on the Internet." More than three quarters of Internet users generally say they were comfortable with online credit card use.
- Blacks are more likely than other Internet users to go online to look for employment. Half of all black Internet users reported looking for work online. This is double the rate for the general Internet population.
- Large numbers of blacks turn to the Internet to obtain health information. Some 44 percent of all African-American Internet users say they get medical information online compared to 31 percent of the nonblack Internet community.
- About 26 percent of all black Internet users participate in online chat rooms. This is more than double the rate for Internet users generally.
- Only 11 percent of African-American Internet users visit "adult content" Internet sites. Some 17 percent of Internet users generally visit adult sites.
- More than 77 percent of all Internet users agree with the statement that "the Internet has made life easier for me." Some 63 percent of black Internet users agree with this statement.
- Only 41 percent of the African-American Internet users agree with the statement, "The Internet is color-blind." Nearly 60 percent of all users believe the Internet is colorblind.
- More than one half of all black Internet users believe that "people of color have unique needs on the Internet." Only 14 percent of Internet users generally agree with this assertion.
- Some 76 percent of black users say they regularly visit black-oriented Web sites.
