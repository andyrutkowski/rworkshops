The Michigan State Police issued the following news release:
As Internet activity at home increases over the holiday break, the Michigan State Police (MSP) is reminding parents the Internet can be a dangerous place for children. By following some safety guidelines, parents can ensure their child's Internet use is both safe and fun this holiday.
"Prevention and awareness is the key to deter online predators and exposure to inappropriate material," said Detective Lieutenant Jim Wolf, commander of the MSP Computer Crimes Unit. "Children are more likely to be trusting, naive, and curious. Diligent parental supervision can help ensure safety on the Internet."
Internet safety tips for parents:
* Place the home computer in a common area to allow for observation of the user's Internet activity.
* Create rules for Internet use, including hours of use, which sites can be accessed and which sites should not be accessed.
* Create a folder of "bookmarks" or "favorites" appropriate to your child's age, which they can visit on the computer's browser. * Teach your child to never give out personal information, such as home address, phone number, E-mail address, password, photograph, credit card number or school information . * Create a family E-mail address that your child can use to send and receive messages. Check the account regularly.
* Know who your child is talking to online. Chat room acquaintances are strangers and children should never arrange to meet them face-to-face. * Teach your child the Internet is fun and educational when used appropriately, but some people don 't use it that way. Remind your child that people on the Internet may not be who they seem.
