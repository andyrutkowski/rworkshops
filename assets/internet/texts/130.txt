The Internet Association issued the following news release:
Internet Association today announced California Senator Steven Bradford (D-35), Senator Henry Stern (D-27), and Assemblymember Monique Limon (D-37) as 2017 California Internet Champions for their leadership and advocacy on internet-related issues in the State Legislature.
"Senator Bradford, Senator Stern, and Assemblymember Limon are champions of the internet economy. Their leadership on internet and technology policy issues is critical to fostering economic growth in California," said Robert Callahan, Internet Association's Vice President, State Government Affairs. "We appreciate their efforts and look forward to future collaboration that ensures Californians continue to reap the benefits of the internet economy."
California has a thriving internet sector, which accounts for 11.5 percent of the state's overall GDP per capita. The internet economy directly employs more than 530,000 people in the Golden State, and its impact increases significantly when considering the 5.8 million positions in the state that earn money through online platforms. There are also over 32,000 California-based businesses in the internet sector, which is more than the state's transportation and warehousing sector.
Internet Association's Internet Champions annual award recognizes California state legislators who have distinguished themselves as vanguards of the internet economy. The awards will be presented this evening at Internet Association's Welcome Back Reception, which celebrates California's persistent leadership in technology and innovation.
